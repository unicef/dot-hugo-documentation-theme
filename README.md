UNICEF Inventory theme, for use with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
Forked from Dot, a Hugo theme by ThemeFisher.


## Examples

* [UNICEF Open Source Inventory](https://unicef.github.io/inventory/)
* [UNICEF Drone DPG Toolkit](https://unicef.github.io/drone-dpgtoolkit/)


## Installation

The recommended installation method for an existing Hugo site is with a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).
Use the commands below to add the theme to an existing Hugo site:

```bash
cd /path/to/hugo-site/
mkdir --parents themes/inventory/
git submodule add git@github.com:unicef/inventory-hugo-theme.git themes/inventory
git commit --signoff --message="Add UNICEF Inventory Hugo theme as a git submodule"
git push
```

### Update a submodule to latest upstream

Sometimes you will want to update the git submodule with new changes added upstream to this repository.
To pull newer upstream changes into your pre-existing git submodule, run the following from your Hugo project root directory:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --rebase
```


## Contributing

If you want to work on this Hugo theme itself, you do not need to use git submodules.
Fork and clone this repository like you would a normal git repository.
Then, open a Pull Request when you have changes to propose.
